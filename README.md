# Object Oriented Programming Project
## Text Editor
This project was developed in the first semester of my second year in Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (Portugal).
Part of it was already done, such as the extra libs and the basic class definitions in edt.textui. The entirety of edt.core and the implementation of the actual methods in the Commands and main function in text.ui was developed by us (me and my group partner).
This project served to teach us a little about software development using the OOP paradigm and some Design Patterns.
